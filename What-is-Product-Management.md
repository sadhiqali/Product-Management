Social factor gets one a quantity or focusses on the traffic. JIO targets the Indian market by understanding the necessity/demand of the majority.
Technology is all about what medium you choose to target, acquire and deliver (TAD)
One needs to have information on the legal formalities and the do’s and don’ts to avoid adverse effects on the business. Legal Factor is directly proportional to the Political factor in 7 of every 10 case

While product managers may not build the actual product, they do produce something very tangible for a team: decisions.
These decisions can be about anything: small ones like a line of copy in the docs, to big ones like what the MVP of a new feature should be.
The decisions PMs make are the ones that unblock their team so they can continue to build. They don’t need to make every decision, but they are responsible for ensuring a decision gets made — whether by them, their team, or their stakeholders.
